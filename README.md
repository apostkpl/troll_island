# TROLL ISLAND
## A Generic Turn-Based RPG, inspired from the 80s-90s RPG era.
### _Work in progress, currently just implementing OOP, inheritance, abstract classes etc, to improve my Java/OOP skills. It's intended to be purely CLI when it comes to gameplay._

## Skills used for this project:
- Object Oriented Programming
- Compiled Languages
- Class inheritance/abstraction
- Java-specific folder structure
- Working with JSON files

## How to run this Game:
It's __not__ intended to be run, yet. But keep in mind that it was implemented using Eclipse Temurin 25 (based on OpenJDK 25), which means a relatively recent version of Java may be needed.
Also, Google's Gson is required, either via Maven, Gradle, or via placing the jar file inside the /lib folder.
